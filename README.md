My personal CV built in react. View the Github Pages link to see the CV itself, and feel free to peruse the source code as well.

The project setup was done using create-react-app, the rest was done by me alone. Feel free to share both the source code and the CV with any recruiters or hiring managers who are looking for Javascript/React developers.
